# Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing Curriculum

A structured, hands-on penetration testing curriculum designed to move from **foundations → exploitation → reporting**, with an emphasis on **real-world methodology**, not just tools.

This repository is intended for:
- Aspiring penetration testers
- Blue teamers learning attacker tradecraft
- Students preparing for certifications (PJPT, PNPT, CEH, OSCP-style thinking)
- Anyone building a **portfolio with substance**

---

## 📌 Objectives

By completing this curriculum, you will be able to:

- Understand the **ethical and legal boundaries** of penetration testing
- Plan and scope penetration tests professionally
- Perform reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation
- Analyze wired, wireless, application, cloud, and IoT attack surfaces
- Communicate findings clearly through professional reporting
- Think like an attacker—and write like a consultant
